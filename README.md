# Easy-Cut
Implementation of "DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of user-defined body parts with deep learning" with Google Colab integration. 

DeepLabCut is a toolbox for markerless tracking of body parts of animals. We can train the neural network to learn the movements of rats, humans, robots, basically any thing! This repository is DeepLabCut. But, we do intergrate it with Google Colab and add a few more features to make it very easy for everyone to use! Also, we can make full use of the Tesla K80 GPU that Colab offers.
