- What computer hardware is required?

Any NVIDIA card with more (or equal) than 8 GB memory should be sufficient to run DeepLabCut (at least with the ResNet 50). No server, or supercomputer is required. These cards can also be installed in standard workstations, if they have enough power supply and space. For reference, we use Dell Precision 79xx series towers and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards.
