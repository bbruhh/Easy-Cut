# Running Easy-Cut on Google Colab

While using Google Colab, you will not need to pre-install anything. The whole method can easily run on the Colab Notebook. The first step is to have the data. Our lab used the [Vatic Annotation tool](https://github.com/cvondrick/vatic), to create a dataset. The Vatic Annotaion Tool breaks the video frame by frame and you can easily annotate the body parts you require and can download the frames and keypoints as XML files.
